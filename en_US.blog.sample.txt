Katie’s grandma and her mother used to be my pets, too. I saw her evolve from being a kitten to being a mother herself up close. As I mentioned earlier, coming home will never be the same again without her warm welcome. From the start, I know that my pet’s situation is precarious. I know she’ll most likely die, but seeing her helplessly moaning because of pain is totally unbearable for me. She may have died in the end, but at least, I know I did what I can to try to save her.
There was something so magical about sitting on the deck in the rocking chairs before the town below came alive, sipping coffee in the cool morning air. It was equally magical in the evenings as the sounds of Eureka's nightlife echoed up soothing my soul. In my humble opinion The Peabody House has the BEST location in town.
By the way, Happy Easter! :)
Anyway – just to finish, here’s a photo of Monkey in my new sling. It’s not the best, I’m sorry, but it’s tough to get photos of us that way! I’m going to instruct Mr Clothbum to help me out so I can show you some more.

Does HE have your attention, now? If not, what's it going to take? Do not be a hard-hearted and stiff necked fool! Do not reject the gift of salvation that costs you nothing and saves everything. If you have already made that transaction but continue to live in self sufficiency, is HE calling you back into fellowship with him? If you are an on fire believer are you praying for this lost world and conforming yourself daily to be like Christ to the damned?

We had our first prenatal class last night. There was only one other woman there, so it was a nice and intimate setting. Jeff was the only Dad though. The other woman’s husband’s truck broke down so he could not attend. I know that Jeff is happy about our baby, but I think he was bored last night. Hopefully next week there will be more Dad’s. We learned about ways to keeps comfortable during pregnancy and during birth. There was a lot about relaxation techniques, like deep breathing and meditation. I’m sure those things might help some people during the birthing process, but I am still getting an epidural. I cannot take pain. We are learning about epidurals and other medicated pain relief at the next class.
If you look back through the blog, you will see that Buller has been to school, he has been camping, and hiking, biking, down the Mississippi River in a canoe. Buller was at family celebrations, and listened to bedtime stories snuggled in a loft bed.
One of my cherished friends told me that she doesn't understand my American sense of patriotism, and she asked me "what does it mean to love a country?". I had no answer for her, but her question is one that I periodically take out, turn over, hold up to the light, and poke at. What does it mean to love a country? What does it mean to love a country?
Why has that been so consistent over time? Simple. It’s not due to “the market” at all. In fact, it’s the result of the behavior of the investors themselves.
At the Presentation at the Temple of Jerusalem when Mary and Joseph brought their first born son to be redeemed, they did not bring a lamb and a turtledove for sacrifice but the poor person`s option: a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons (See: Luke 2:22-40 and Leviticus 12)
Standing impossibly low and small, with wire-thin steering wheel and sticklike gear shift, the first Morris Mini Minor that rolled off the conveyor belt in 1959 is part of the V&A exhibition. By 1963 my future husband was driving a replica in white and memories of the 1969 movie The Italian Job sprung to mind. By the late 60’s I was studying ceramics and British potters like Hans Coper, Lucie Rie, Ruth Duckworth, David Leach and Micheal Cardew, all on view in the Exhibition, were my idols. Then came the young innovators like Jacqueline Poncelet and Elizabeth Fritsch pushing the boundaries with slip cast bone china and jewel-like applications of coloured slip and I became the possessor of a triple beam balance and my days were obsessed with mixing kaolin to create my own translucent slip-cast porcelain and gruelling hours of piercing minutes holes through paper thin pots only to have them disintegrate in my hands.
How on earth can October almost be over? Time has been just flying by. It seems that just doing the regular day to day things have taken so much time that I have little time left for blogging. Every so often I get a chance to visit a blog or two, but not as many as I'd like. When I realized that the month is almost over I couldn't believe it. We've had mostly beautiful fall weather and every chance I get I run out to do a little cleaning up or planting. Yesterday the Littlest Gardener and I spent a couple of hours cleaning up the front raised beds, emptying containers, cutting things back and even planted a few bulbs. I just never know when the last of the sun will be and want to soak in every ray I can!

Howard Bahr has a wondrously rich and picturesque style. You can’t get much closer to being a true witness than you will with the acutely sensitive descriptions that make his story tangible. Howard Bahr’s writing allows the reader to visualize, hear and feel the battle. You will witness a slaughter from the soldiers’ point of view. You will see the the nefarious images they encounter of the dead and grossly maimed. It is an unworldly place to be. Likewise he is sensitive to the emotional pain and thoughts of his characters with phrases that will wrap around you like a warm hug. His prose is poetry.
Anyway, after a night of being eyeballed and Minority Report stalked as the lotus flower bomb of some guy’s eye and running off in the other direction to marry Mr. Ciroc, my stomach was punishing me for inhaling my food during the night. I don’t think I ever tasted the shrimp or the fries…as soon as the food came out…poof…it was all gone. That being said, I had to eat something for lunch and I decided that I was going to order Chinese food.

Davis: Actually, several hundred pages on Pentecostalism are now being decanted in the second volume, written with Forrest Hylton, where they properly belong. But the historical significance of Pentecostalism – evangelical Christianity – is that it’s the first modern religious movement, I believe – or religious sect – which emerged out of the urban poor. Although there are many gentrified Pentecostal churches in the United States today, and even in places like Brazil, the real crucible of Pentecostalism – the spiritual experience which propels it – the whole logic of Pentecostalism – remains within the urban poor.

It seems I have a problem with this blog.
I have been “different” for as long as I could imagine; I attributed it to many things, to my being adopted, to my excessive shyness, to the fact that I felt from a fairly early age that I preferred women to men but there was more to it than that. It almost felt as if my brain operated differently from other peoples’; my social skills, no matter how I tried and tried to improve them, through going to parties, public speaking classes and many other techniques improved only slightly. I had obsessive thoughts which I couldn’t control and my moods didn’t seem to have anything to do with what was going on on the outside.

Possibly long overdue for a DVD release is the first season adventure, “The Sensorites.” “Long overdue” because the titular alien race were the influence for the prominently featured new series race, the Ood; “Possibly” because the Sensorites aren’t particularly fascinating figures, and Ood fanatics (surely you exist?) dying to get a peek at the mysterious species’ origins, are likely to come away wondering how the Sensorites were the inspiration for anything.
It’s only the second ever quilt I’ve made and the hexagons were a challenge for me. I have no real flair for sewing, just bloody minded determination and sore fingers. Anyway, the piecing is done (yay!) and after ironing it tomorrow I can start the actual quilting. I’m only doing a basic pattern since I’m a beginner, so it won’t be as bad as the hexagons, at least I hope not.

Well, then this evening Jdad was trying to reach into his truck to get out the flowers he bought me for Valentine's Day and slipped out of his wheelchair onto the wet pavement. We gathered him back up into his chair and all seemed fine. He did complain of a little pain (which is pretty abnormal since he can feel nothing from the nipple down) but he said it was more like back pain so I didn't worry too much. He got ready for bed and laid down and then asked me if I thought it was weird that his leg would do "this". "This" turned out to be his knee bending at a 90 degree angle TOWARD his thigh. Holy cats. Yes this is weird! His leg was totally misshapen and swollen. We jumped in the van and flew off to the VA where they promptly affirmed my suspicion: a complete fracture of his left femur. Not to be the simple type of guy, he also threw in a hairline fracture of the right femur. Luckily, there didn't appear to be any internal bleeding as there often can be with such a large break. They decided to admit him and have it surgically reduced in the next day or so.
I had hoped to be moving on from Michael Pollan’s comments on Eating Animals by now, but after I finished composing my last post, I realized that the situation nicely demonstrated a point that I consider important.

I started feeling grunty at the ends of contractions. My brain said “I bet it’s a lip.” But not long after I felt very pushy. I went to the loo and after having a contraction in there I declared “I’m getting in.” I climbed in and it felt utterly gorgeous. I shut my eyes and swayed from side to side, zoning out completely.

If money is the root of all evil, than many of us are rooting for it! David Walman takes us on a journey, The End of Money: Counterfeiters, Preachers, Technies, Dreamers—and the Coming Cashless Society ($25.00, Da Capo Press) in which he explores what the world would be like without cash, giving the reader a crash course on the rise and fall of physical money, beginning with Marco Polo’s fascinating with the paper notes who saw circulating in China, then taking a look at the gold standard and the ascent of national currencies. In our rapidly changing, technologically advanced world, people around the world are embracing new ways of replacing the local bank with a cell phone apt. It is an interesting look at the way the exchange of money has changed over the years and what it is likely to be in the future.

“Then he threw his arms around his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin embraced him, weeping” (Genesis 45:14). “They all wept as they embraced him and kissed him. What grieved them most was his statement that they would never see his face again. Then they accompanied him to the ship. After we had torn ourselves away from them, we put out to sea and sailed straight to Cos” (Acts 20:37-21:1). “The brothers there had heard that we were coming, and they traveled as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. At the sight of these men Paul thanked God and was encouraged” (Acts 28:15).
So that’s what all of this is saying, one of the things I want to start writing about is mental illness, how I deal with it, what my problems are, and what I find online regarding the illness and how to cope with it. Maybe it will help somebody. Maybe there’s a reader out that who found – or will find – this blog and it will help them. I think we have already discovered by some of what I’ve written that I’m not completely “healthy.”

Those exceptions aside, the basic selection bias principle at work is clear: if you think Jesus was a well-meaning legend, you’re not likely to spend the time and money getting the sort of credentials that will let you in to Habermas’s study. A powerful example of this selection bias at work is the exclusion of Earl Doherty, whom Carrier described as “one of the most expert amateurs I have ever encountered.” But Doherty — who only has undergraduate degrees in History and Classical Languages, not Ph.Ds — doesn’t qualify as a biblical scholar, and so he’s out.

That being said, I don’t know how I’ve been lately. I’ve had a lot on my mind. Nothing in my life is terrible or excellent at the moment, although I can’t shake the feeling that something might be a little off. The sensation is sort of like not realizing that you’re being bothered by an itchy clothing tag or an offensive background noise until suddenly it’s brought to your attention in a sudden flash of awareness. I’ve been so busy and distracted that it’s only lately I’ve begun to feel something like that tickling the edge of my brain, trying to break through.

Never mind that the "Climategate" scandal had only recently exposed how climate scientists working for the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had conspired to quash evidence contrary to the theory of man-made global warming.

In closing, think about it like this: Money is not everything, but it darn sure helps. But money to us is different than money to someone who has none.** When you have less money than you require, or need then you lack in part of your life. This is a sad reality for us here, but even greater abroad. I have a friend right now showing me just how big God can be if you let him, and it is amazing to see the transformation that is occurring in him both spiritually as well as physically. My pal, and and all around great guy, Brian Carpenter is walking his feet raw on a pathway known as the Appalachian trail as we speak. (I will put a link to his blog on my blog roll, as well as add it to the bottom of the page.) He is truly living like he is dying right now. He is “walking for water” to fund wells for those that walk miles daily to secure water for their families. This is something passionate that he has felt in his heart and is answering a calling to do so. He is right now a month in, and has already done great things by gathering enough money to fully fund one well so far! This is what God needs us to do. Die to ourselves, and put others needs before ours. Be the big brother to a person in need, and show love when you can. Be a helping hand like no other, and walk until your feet are ready to bleed because no sacrifice is as great as the one that God made for us by sending Christ to be crucified. Be the hands and feet, heart and spirit of God to somebody else. He will prosper you as He has stated. He would not forsake us, and so He simply asks us to not forsake others. Is that too much to ask of someone that you have given everything to?

The lyrics to their songs are captivating. Again, they do have a dark/gothic edge to their sound. They sing about dark journeys, relationships, and interior thoughts. They have a good balance of songs that make me dance, to songs that I just need to relax and listen to. They definitely shake up the typical song structure. Sarah’s voice is very sweet, thick with her British accent, but very ironic to their lyrics, which I love. Their style is really fun and cool. You can catch Sarah with a neat glamorous hairdo like above, to bed head punk. The boys have their signature hair styles, being playful with what they wear as well.

For the next thirteen Summers, Treadwell camped in parts of Alaska where the amount of wild bear activity was at its highest. He called his first camping spot the “Grizzly Sanctuary” where day in and day out, he observed, photographed, and even touched and played with bear cubs. He did not carry any self-defence items, not even a can of bear mace (he did this once and used it once, and felt so horrible about the pain he caused the bear that he vowed never to do this again), and claimed that he was able to create a mutual friendship with the bears. Due to his camping in the same spot for many season, he saw many of the same bears every season, watched them grow up from bear cubs, even named them, and for these reasons firmly believed that he developed a friendly and respectful mutual relationship with them.

Research indicates that a diet high in added sugar reduces the production of a brain chemical known as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Without BDNF, our brains can’t form new memories and we can’t learn (or remember) much of anything. Levels of BDNF are particularly low in people with an impaired glucose metabolism—diabetics and pre-diabetics—and as the amount of BDNF decreases, sugar metabolism worsens.

The Socialist intellectual David Goodhart in Prospects (March 1998), quoted Conservative M.P. David Willetts on the Welfare State: "The basis on which you can extract large sums of money in tax and pay it out in benefits is that most people think the recipients are people like themselves, facing difficulties which they themselves could face. If values become more diverse, if lifestyles become more differentiated, then it becomes more difficult to sustain the legitimacy of a universal risk-pooling welfare state. People ask, 'Why should I pay for them when they are doing things I wouldn't do? … Progressives want diversity but they thereby undermine part of the moral consensus on which a large welfare state rests... The traditional conservative Burkean view is that our affinities ripple out from our families and localities, to the nation and not very far beyond. That view is pitted against a liberal universalist one which sees us in some sense equally obligated to all human beings from Bolton to Burundi … .”

During the demonstrations each of the animals and birds were provided with piecs and chunks of raw meat by their trainers. I'm not usually fond of seeing such demonstrations but each of these animals had been raised in captivity and had not been wild caught. Also, children have a rare treat of seeing a live specimen close up working with humans. At the rate habitat for these animals is disappearing it's defintely time to start educating people about how to save them, and in doing so, probably save humans, too, in the long run.

The third Monday (March 19th) Barbara Leonard is going to share a special Sherbet Sheep and Friends blog. Oh my. Don't tell Keebs, but Sherbet might be the cutest sheep ever. A sheep wearing wellies, gardening gloves, riding his bike around the countryside, visiting his friends? I don't need to say more.

We get more rules and regulations all the time. It is all designed to be "good" for us. Perhaps it is but it also seems expensive. It is why we have to hand out $275 million to Holden (and another $60m to surrounding components plants).

The day was filled with a self guided walking tour of Portland (museums, shops, nature, etc.) finally ending with an attempt to go to the 24th annual Oregon Brewer's Festival. Bad mistake... There were 85 beer vendors at the festival and each had a line 100+ deep to get a beer. WOW! So we decided to come back to the festival on Sunday afternoon, hoping for smaller crowds.

One would think that since we are never home... it would be spotless, but it is just the opposite. Since we just occasionally stop in, sleep and eat... mess is building up. There are toys all over the place, old food leftovers in the fridge, crumbs all over the floor and laundry piling up. With little energy, I couldn't stand it anymore... so I tidied up what I could to make it look at least a little more livable. I then rewarded myself with a little DVR catch-up time and then a hot bath.

I finally realized that when Jesus talked about coming between a father and son… it meant that there really is a spiritual battle going on and we are told to not choose anyone in this life over Jesus. If you are disfellowshipped for questioning the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, that means you took your spiritual walk seriously and sought the real truth.

Everybody has aspirations, desires and dreams. Some dream to be rich, some to become a celebrity and some to find true love. But we seldom think about what we are doing with our time, skills and energy towards attaining these things. More importantly we never think if we are truly working towards becoming worthy of what we desire for. The simple wisdom behind this states that if and when one becomes worthy of something they will soon acquire it. This means for example: if you wish to become a successful writer, then you will have to begin to hone your skills as a writer and keep learning to become better as a writer. And once you work towards such dreams you will eventually pave your way to becoming a great writer and success will eventually meet you. Likewise, if you do not conduct yourself in a manner that commands respect you will never get it by demanding it. You can never get true respect, love or recognition unless you earn them by your behaviour that is worth of such things.

Our beach is not a very big one and constantly subject to erosion. I have the feeling that our property owner's association fee for using the beach in the summer (quite steep--but I find it hard not to cave in and scrape up the dough when the beach in question is 100 yards from my front door) entails adding sand to the beach in time for summer beach-going.
There was a time a few years ago when this blog had some very active detractors who, in the interest, I think, of correcting me on my evidently bad course, left hurtful and even vicious messages in the comboxes (must I mention that these trolls generally self-identified as orthodox Catholics?). One, after I had written something in a comment about one's art, if one is a mother, being able to flourish more readily when one has cash in hand for child care, helpfully sought to remind me that the arts were for "people with TALENT," which is to say not for poor schlubs like me, international performing credits, scholarly publications, and at-that-time A.B.D. in music notwithstanding. Another real-life former friend, a self-styled apologist with a strong internet presence, incensed by something I had written here on a different topic, similarly blasted me for my "unsuccess" at everything I'd endeavored, from music to marriage to motherhood (this same erstwhile friend, before he started hating me quite so much, had asked me to sing at his father's wake and funeral, which I did, taking a cab from the Bronx twice to another far-off outer borough of the City of New York, vomiting from morning sickness much of the way), and, further, suggested that I wickedly blamed this unsuccess on my children, both living and dead. You have a happy life too, buddy!
Which is why I think that perhaps the reason that Elvis isn’t considered an artist who made major social change – revolutionary social change no less – is because he was Southern – and not the ideal sort of educated, obviously left leaning and non-religious – as other entertainers who are deemed artists present themselves.

The scary part is that had the Iranians succeeded, Saudi Arabia and Iran would surely have either gone to war, perhaps dragging the U.S. in too, or tensions would have escalated to a point of no return, with each nation on edge and severe jockeying in the Islamic world. This is scary because Iran and Saudi Arabia are major oil producing and exporting nations, and any war between them would have been disastrous for world oil markets.

Since they continued staring at me in puzzlement, I asked them to think about times they’ve been sent to their rooms with instructions to sit quietly on their beds until they can explain why they were sent thither and show some remorse for whatever caused the sending, then asked them what I usually do when they emerge. Both quickly replied that I greet them with hugs and kisses, just as the young man’s father did. “That’s absolutely right,” I told my daughters, “and, while I’m always happy to see your adorable little faces, I’m even happier that you’ve decided you want to do good things instead of unkind ones.”
I really enjoy the Windsor’s scones, too. They always have two choices of tasty scones, a seasonal one such as cranberry or pumpkin and a classic one like maple or oat. They are very good. Not the best I’ve had (that honor would go to these incredible scones I had in the Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn, I think it was at Choice Greene, this magical artisanal cheese, grocer, baker and charcuterie shop near BAM, scones that were so authentically British and perfect in every way, they were better than some I’ve had in England! I also love the very Scottish/Irish scones at Babington’s Tea Room in Rome, which are dry and dense and crumbly and are served with freshly whipped clotted cream and Italian strawberry jam. Babington’s is a 19th-century tea room started up by two Englishwomen and it’s like stepping back in time. Some noted British food critics have claimed it’s more of an “English tea experience than one you’ll find in London, very classic.”

Eventually, we want to remove more and more processed foods from our diet even if the food is organic. But you have to start somewhere, right?

THE AVENGERS TV Spot Balance The Avengers (titled Avengers Assemble in some countries) is a 2012 American superhero film produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures, based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name. It is the sixth installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Your viewpoint shapes your thoughts, decisions, actions — and ultimately, your feeling of success. For example, have you ever wondered why people in some of the poorest parts of the world seem happier than those in the wealthiest nations? It’s probably because they view life through the values-lenses of health and family versus wealth and fame. Of course, those choices are not mutually exclusive. However, if you lose the latter you can recover, if you lose the former you’re truly lost. Remember a time when your perspective changed dramatically, such as falling in love or a death in the family. In an instant, your orientation shifted. What you placed in focus was different. The world may have looked brighter, or dimmer. You may have been prompted to action. If you just welcomed the birth of your first child, for example, you may start thinking about the quality of the local school system or have the impetus to leave work earlier.

Not much different from the final LP version, a monitor mix is a rough-and-ready mixdown done at the recording desk, mainly used by the band (and producer) to see what needs tightening/redoing (if anything) prior to the final mixdown. This completely lacks the gentle acoustic rhythm guitar track pervasive through the final LP version as well, though it does emphasize the lovely, simple, emotive Marr electric track. I think I prefer this to the final LP version; it's subtlety wins it for me.

Spectators lined both sides from start to finish, and there was music blasting, live bands, a couple of drum lines, dozens cheering, clapping, people spraying the runners with garden hoses and handing out oranges, water, popsicles, ice, etc. I had my iPod, but half the time I couldn't even hear my music over the cheering crowd; hundreds of thousands of people watched the race.

So, here it is. My experiment. In the coming weeks I will post the first 2 or 3 chapters of my novel in plain text on this blog as well as a link to download the audio versions of these chapters. I plan on including music in the audio versions. Some of my instrumental music to start with and then possibly branching out to other groups or artists who would like to join forces with me. I will continue to do this for the entire 4th draft of my novel, cover to cover. Some things will likely change from time to time, but we will see how it goes.

Although Sirkus will surely be missed, Sigga isn’t too worried. “There’s no need. This kind of energy always finds its way,” she concludes.
Rynn Williams, 47, a poet, and mother of three, died at her home in Brooklyn “of accidental causes.” She could be any one of us.

Jesus experienced this dark night of the soul prior to his public mission as he ‘wrestled with Satan’ in the wilderness. Buddha also experienced this during his process of enlightenment as he fought the ‘temptations of Mara’. It is only frightening as long as we are afraid to die. Once we realize that there is no ‘self’ left to die, a new dawn can begin. If we choose to enter and experience our own dark night we must be willing to deeply examine our past and all aspects of from an emotional level, and then accept our humanity and practice forgiveness. Then, release the past and move forward to be part of the human community.

This is the exact kind of scene you want to milk. You’ve set up a dangerous situation. The stakes are through the roof (literally). You’ve left your youngest character alone. Go to town with this scene. Zoe watches them, for example, from the underground “periscope,” and thinks she sees breathers running towards them. She has to warn them, but has no way to. We cut back and forth between the breathers getting closer and Zoe trying to open a hatch she’s not strong enough to open. The brothers milk every second of this scene, and appropriately so, as it’s the perfect kind of scene you want to milk.
I hope you will learn the lesson of the snake. My Father faced down the snake, not because of his courage, his bravery, or his power. He faced the snake because he knew that no matter how terrible the snake looked, the snake was already dead. The same is true of that serpent the devil. You see the real battle occurred several thousand years ago, and the victory has already been won for you. God sent his one and only Son in the person of Jesus Christ into the world to save mankind from sin, and to save man from Satan’s sinister plans.
When the BLP government had to back down, a betrayed Kerins announced that he’d paid his “consulting” fees to the tune of a couple of million dollars and the government couldn’t back out of the deal. HA! Wrong thing to say ’bout hey. Everything worked fine until Kerins said one word about “consulting fees” and then it was game over for obvious reasons.

1) Referral acquisition is no longer reliant on word of mouth: Just a few short years ago, in order to cultivate referrals, financial and insurance professionals needed to deliver good products and service, communicate consistently and give clients an experience to talk with others about. Today all of that is still true, but it becomes meaningless unless what people are ultimately saying about you matches what can be found online.
I had the Icon version, a 1.6 litre engine with heated leather seats, leather steering wheel and gear shift. I can remember the smell of the new leather, the feel of the shifter in my hand, and the sight of the slight bulge in the centre of the bonnet, which when sat in the driver seat, gave a wonderful waved outline that made it feel like you were driving a classic Aston Martin or something. And as it was Sunlight Silver it shimmered when the sun shone.

Next, be prepared for a change in both design and format of this blog as it becomes my primary and I work to slowly retire Many Worlds. You may see posts here that seem to have little to do with this blog’s general theme as I port all my older posts over. They aren’t that alien in truth. Writing, creativity, passion… Here or there, I have always strove to experience and share them.
A couple of thoughts I’ve had. First, there would clearly need to be similar safeguards for shareholder voting as apply to voting in parliamentary and local elections – to avoid institutional shareholders simply hoovering up individual’s votes as a block.

I lazily meander back across the parking lot watching the riders on their playfully trotting horses. I’ve really got a lot of things to get caught up on at the still-under-construction new and larger brewery, but I decide to watch the jockeys a little while longer. I know I’m the one goofing off, but leaning against the saddle of my iron steed and watching the hard working jockeys seems at the time to be a very productive way to waste much of my morning.

The most exciting thing about the win is that the Union finished it with nine men on the field. Keon Daniel and Gabriel Farfan were both sent off for rough tackles in the second half. Zac MacMath the Union Defense deserve a lot of credit for holding on to the narrow lead. They extended the Union’s clean sheet streak to 332 minutes, more than three and a half games.

The book industry right now is in serious transition. Big stores like Borders and Barnes and Noble took over the marketplace some years ago - putting a lot of the indy stores out of business. I mean, who doesn't want to go to a big store with great coffee and a billion books? Problem is, evidently not enough people to keep all those stores open. Both big chains have struggled and now Borders is likely filing bankrupcy and closing 150 stores. (I'm praying for a last minute intervention, but it's not looking great.)
It's true. It doesn't matter if it's on a 60 inch plasma screen, it gives me a headache if I stay at it for a certain period of time. Even with my new glasses, I just can't seem to stay at it for very long. In addition to the headaches, I also can't seem to comprehend what I'm reading. I see words and my eyes scan the screen, but I have to work very hard to focus so the words actually register. Because of this, it takes me ten times longer to read off a screen rather than paper because I have to read and re-read and re-read small paragraphs until I finally "get it". I even have to write my blog posts in short intervals.
Optional: If you desire to marinate your steak tips before cooking, put the meat cubes in a large plastic food bag and add: olive oil, redwine vinegar, Worcestshire Sauce, Kosher salt and crushed pepper. Some people like to add ketchup also. Dried herbs can be added such as Tarragon and Rosemary. Close the plastic food bag after all ingredients are sealed inside and shake/turn the bag to distribute the marinade. Put the bag into the refrigerator for 15-20 min. Drain and put the cubed steak tips on a plate ready to bring to your grill. Follow grilling instructions above.

Just after Christmas I received an email from Ray Daniels. It was like getting a letter from a college you had applied to (I assume. I never applied to any...). I read the top and couldn't bring myself to go on. I didn't want to know if I failed, so I was ready to not know if I passed. With more curiosity than courage, I glanced down, past the word "Congratulations," to the part that had my scores. Holy cuss. I passed.
The plane took off in a direction where we were headed towards central Delhi, and had to take a U turn to correct the direction.

In my JSTOR reading yesterday I came across a journal article by Sharon O’Brien called “Remembering Skibbereen”, based on her memoir “ The Family Silver”. Her belief is that these silenced memories of Famine deprivation, hunger, family loss, and the precariousness of housing and land, remain sub-consciously with descendants to this day, sometimes manifesting in depression or bewildering family behaviour patterns. If there is any validity to this hypothesis imagine the impact of this experience on Biddy Gollagher, Irish Famine Orphan, about whom I recently posted a story.
Nothing spells gloom like My Dying Bride, a band that has been at the forefront of the doom metal genre since their inception in the early 90′s. Though emotionally and thematically very much in the wake of their past material, Evinta rids itself of guitars and all other typical instruments in favor of classical instruments, creating a powerful, epic, atmospheric, expansive (3-disc) ambient/neo-classical experience.
The same might apply to your family or your home. Your brother may need help. The family rally round to offer support - it may be financial or emotional or practical. Or, your roof springs a leak - you don't leave it (I hope!), you get up there and fix it or call someone in to do it, because not doing so would mean damaged timbers, sodden carpets, wrecked furniture. You treat your home as an extension of yourself - your world - you protect it because in doing so you ensure your own well being.
I always thought, I have them; I can hold them. They’ll be okay. But in that instant I realized that nothing is safe and with all my strength I could never protect them from forces like a plane crash.

So, out of curiosity, I wanted to pose this question:
I started reading romance really young. That surprised my co-worker as well. I had made it through all of my grandmothers Barbara Cartland books at 13 or 14. I found a copy of the Flame and the Flower at her house when I was 14 and read it. I really didn't read a LOT of romance except when I was at Mimi's house until I hit college. After that I glommed onto authors like a crazy person.

Can we dignify this approach by calling it medicine? Or, is it more accurately described as a form of sorcery? The sole reliance on Pharmaceuticals reveals quite a lot about the agenda underpinning modern medical practice. The Greek word Pharmakon has the following meanings: ”drug, poison, potion, charm, spell, enchantment,” and indeed, pharmaceutical-driven medicine serves the Pharmaceutical Industry’s ultimate agenda: throw as many expensive pills as possible at the problem to make as much profit as is possible. (if you can do this while generating the illusion that you are actually “treating” disease with poisonous potions, you have succeeded in casting the right spell).
When I was given the opportunity to work with the Mindwaves project I was very excited about the prospect. Not only did I consider it work that I believed in but I also appreciated the experience it would give me. Having once had mental problems myself I understood that it was difficult for people to share their problems due to the stigma attached. I felt that by promoting good stories surrounding mental health we could help tackle this serious problem. I too have taken a great interest in journalism and found this to be the ideal role in giving me experience. On a much more personal level, the role has given me a renewed sense of purpose. It has also aided in my recovery from depression.
A few more small findings (you can use anything...findings for scrapbooks, buttons etc.)
I really don't like Citadel Finecast and while its true I have not had a lot of experience of them and have not had some of the terrible miscasts that so many others have had I still don't like them. I find they are far too brittle and where if you dropped either a metal or plastic mini you would likely get away with no damage a Finecast is liable to snap. Even holding one too tightly will likely result in a spear, sword or arm etc in snapping off. There is little chance that I will buy any more and the prices they charge for such an inferior product is shocking.

Second boyfriend is the true musician - he still makes his living that way. He was a bit of a prodigy.

He was all of 17 at the time.

That is the truth, not the huge lie now being told to excuse what some ex-colonies have done to their inheritance particularly in Africa, that Colonialism, especially British colonialism was the cause of the dire situations in which some ex-colonial countries now find themselves. A calumny which is easily exposed as the lie it is.
For some strange reason, the first time I saw the teaser for Ladies Vs Ricky Bahl (LVRB), I caught the last frame where Ranveer stares at the viewer with the words “you’re next” leading me to think this was a film about a serial killer – however, thanks to the de rigeur incessant promotion of films in general these days, that notion was quickly put to rest. But there was no avoiding the red and white nightingale voiced elephant in the room that is Band Baaja Baaraat – after all, this is the first film reuniting Maneesh, Anushka and Ranveer since BBB (which took us all by surprise and made itself comfortable in our hearts and minds) and expectations were high. And try as we might, the comparison with BBB would remain, despite the best of intentions.

As well, Kon Ichikawa's extraordinary The Makioka Sisters (1983), which Criterion has also released on DVD this summer, explores the conflicts between the traditions of the past and the modern world encroaching on those traditions. But Ichikawa, whose movies (Kagi, Fires on the Plain, The Burmese Harp) often ride on waves of inchoate emotions moving towards a sense of discovery, addresses those changes with evocative colourful impressions rather than through familiar narrative devices. While the film is based on a Junichiro Tanizaki novel (as was Kagi), The Makioka Sisters departs from some of the plot designs of the book and creates instead an evocation of a way of life that reveals the fleeting impermanence of beauty. It may be one of the few pictures where colour reveals as much about the dramatic moods as does the plot.

I think we need to see more women breastfeeding their babies in public whether it be in photos or in real life, it should be a sight that everyone in the country sees on a regular basis because until that happens women are always going to feel like they are doing something wrong when they are doing the most natural thing in the world.
I hear music in the car and I think of Mr. Curry's eyes and his hands on me and how he tells me he loves me like he is thirsty and I am water and I think of our four children and their beautiful bodies moving in this world and their spirits so well loved and I know that I have everything. I also know that medications and insurance and these kinds of things that us poor people are so obsessed with talking about have the power to ruin our lives. If my husband takes the wrong magic pill because a psychiatrist should be evaluating him but instead an I-Phone is, that could ruin our lives. If he got sick enough badly enough he could end up hospitalized or leaving me or forcing me to leave him. All I can do is work full time and that is not full time enough.

Whatever you make, you will enjoy it, and it's so easy and quick to make this beautiful salad.

This is a big day for the church. This is a big day for Christianity, or at least, it should be. Not just because it’s another event on our liturgical calendars that we can cross off. Not because it’s the 1st pre-curser to Easter (if you don’t celebrate Ash Wednesday). And not because the cute little kids wave palm branches around and yell: “Hosanna.”
As for e-books - what can you say, welcome to the future. It’s going to dominate without question. There is no reason why a self publisher can’t compete head on. Provided you put your work through a professional pipeline and make it the best it can be. It should sit shoulder to shoulder with traditionally published books with little or no difference in physical quality. All you need is great content and to market it. Check out mine on the Kindle store and compare it to a traditional book, there is ZERO difference in appearance, and because it’s been through the mill, the content matches many traditional books out there. But don’t take my word for it, see for yourself. You can try the free 10% sample the Amazon Kindle store gives away with every book, but be warned, you’ll want to buy it! :-)
An example of the Little Red symbology in play is Jin-Roh. And Jin-Roh is, by all means, the best fictional depiction of what it means to be a wolf, in my humble opinion, in the context of Japanese pop culture. It’s a little more psychologically edgier than the simple “ronin” or lone wolf concept, which is more about the individualism that we Americans associate with our cultural heritage. Indeed, in order to appear wolf-like, these individuals have to exist alongside with normal human beings, and even work with them. It is very hard to act aloof and deceptive if there’s nobody close to you. It’s why the Big Bad Wolf gets to have a conversation with Little Red Riding Hood. The culture of fitting in, as it is in Japan, makes the wolf blend in to his or her environs easier. It’s the wolf’s disguise.

I chose from among the many quotes and typed them into my word processor. Then I printed the quotes, cut them out and glued them to inexpensive paper plates. Fruit and veggie stickers dress up the plates just a bit. I thought about using pictures of food cut from magazines, but the stickers were easier. I have made a plate for each child, and some will have the same quote. I have ten quotes altogether with ten songs. I did not list the title on the plate. This may be too many songs to get through in twenty minutes. So, if time is short, I can use fewer quotes by removing those plates.

On November 24th, I brewed what I call a Winter Saison, with a starting gravity of 1.074 / 18 degrees Plato. I used two yeast varieties. One home-slanted variety that I've used before, and an actual wine yeast, namely Wyeast Bordeaux. They are still very active, even though I've transferred to secondary fermentation. At the time of the transfer, the gravity had been reduced to a specific gravity of 1.032 (or 8 degrees Plato).

We have a lot of basil in our garden, somehow this year I've managed to grow more of it than I normally use (there seems to be forever a jar of pesto in the fridge!), which just means that I've become a bit more creative in how I use it, or (most of the time) just throw it into dishes more often. It added an extra dimension to a stir fry of thinly sliced kangaroo (marinated briefly in soy, sambal oelek and garlic), mushrooms, a red pepper from the garden and jasmine rice - its stronger aniseed notes went really well with the asian flavours in the wok. It was such a simple delicious dinner, I'm no longer bound by Italian cooking when thinking of how to use my basil! I have purple basil as well, but tend to use the green basil more often purely because I have more of it, it's thrived where the purple basil has been much more subdued (though its a very pretty addition to any garden!).
On closer inspection there are plenty of positive points.

A mother loves the tiny seed within her womb, nurturing the possibility of life with all her being. A mother gives birth to a child's dreams and schemes, breathing as her child breathes, crying as her child cries, falling as her child falls. A mother watches over her child, holding on with all her heart to their dreams of flight, fearing with all her being the inevitability of their falling, and letting go of holding on in the certainty of their flying free.
Selecting a suitable lover for the queen would have been a challenging yet rewarding assignment. Would Richard Gere, the American gigolo, have been the right type of gallant to loosen her corset strings and caress the inhibitions from body? No, he was too vain and mercenary. What the queen really needed was to be idolised by a fancy boy who would have gurgled with gratitude every time she curtsied on his face. A job, I feel, for a fervent little Frenchman in the Charles Aznavour mould – an Energizer Bunny of Love who would have taken pride in being the queen’s official sex toy.

Because the egg wash helps the bread stick together when you roll it up, after adding the sugar. Butter is more like a barrier and this leaves gaps in the dough that show up when sliced.

Metta World Peace. It’s all been said, he’s clearly not sane. Fortunately for the Lakers, despite the impressive April World Peace was having, their playoff hopes do not rest on the far from level head of that man. Unfortunately for the Lakers, they have plenty other problems, their lack of depth chief among them. Also, their 3-7 record against the five teams above them in the standings (Oklahoma City,San Antonio,Chicago,Miami, andIndiana) is disconcerting. Having said all that, anything is possible with Kobe Bryant leading your team. And don’t forget they haven’t lost any of that length that gave them an advantage over every team they played en route to winning titles in 2009 and 2010.

I had no idea that Jackie was such a great writer. Not only in speech-writing or writing articles for magazines, but also in writing personal letters. Persuasive, and always charming, personal letters from Jackie helped to restore much of the furniture in the White House that had been sold, auctioned off, or given way by previous Presidents. That's a pretty wonderful letter that influences a family to donate a priceless antique that had been owned by a US President, but that's exactly what many families did in response to Jackie's handwritten letters.

No, they never let it get to that point. I do, however. It upsets me, but I guess not enough to reform me into a domestic do-gooder. I’m sorry honey, but I’m never going to be that kind of wifey.
Right after depositing a paycheck into our sad, sad excuse for a bank account, we headed to the courthouse to get a copy of our recorded marriage license.

A tiny incision is made in the abdomen and a slender, hollow, lighted instrument is inserted through it. This lets the doctor view the ovary more closely and to obtain a piece of tissue for microscopic examination. If the tumor appears large, a laparotomy is performed under general anesthesia.
Yesterday morning, we finished up our coloring books about the parable of the prodigal son. As the last crayon strokes were being applied, I asked Beanie and Bugaboo what they thought made the father in the story so happy. Both of them replied the father had thought his younger son was dead, but when he showed up alive, he was so happy he threw a huge party to celebrate. Their wee brows furrowed as I explained to them the father was certainly relieved to see his younger son safely home, but his real joy was in the young man’s loving repentance, and realization that his pursuit of all earthly delights had led him to ruin. The father, I went on to explain, was wild with joy that his son had returned with a wish to work hard and live uprightly.
There is no singular stellar aspect to this place, but everything is above average. Good bartenders, a few beers on tap that we would actually drink, not far from the house, bonus points for regularly having people 55+ enjoying a pint or two, bonus points for having Bob Reeder and other Irish acts from time to time. It looks like a suburban chain restaurant from the outside (which it was in a previous life) but inside is cozy and welcoming. Until we try a couple more places on our list, this is likely our go-to place for a nearby drink.
Still no electricity, but at least with water I am able to percolate some coffee on the grill and use our solar shower to keep everyone clean.
Independence, Missouri: The “center place” where the New Jerusalem would be built and the Savior would return. Near the Garden of Eden. A temple was to be built in Joseph Smith’s generation in preparation for the Second Coming of Christ, but persecution by evil non-Mormons thwarted the work of the Lord, and the gathering place was moved north and east. At some point, faithful Mormons expect to be called to abandon their homes and their worldly goods and gather to the New Jerusalem.
Some days I feel like such an orphan on this earth with having both Mom and Dad gone. But I'm reminded that this earth is not our home. Our home is in heaven. I have hope...some day soon I'll get to be reunited with both of them again. Oh, how I can't wait for that day.

One of the things I value from the best filmmakers is the kind of empathetic awareness of human foible that Rohmer seemed to always exude even when his characters could sometimes drive you up the wall with the intellectualizing of their innermost faiths and passions. But that, of course, was Rohmer's great universal subject, at least judging by the films of his I've seen: the distance between intellect and passion, between what one says and what one thinks. Despite films like My Night at Maud's (1969) and Love in the Afternoon (1972) being among the ones lumped under the "Moral Tales" moniker, they were never simplistic or facile in their morals; Rohmer's gaze was by turns ironic, affectionate, detached and exploratory, but above all, it was remarkably alert to the sometimes problematic ways we human beings try to reconcile the warring factions of heart and mind. Even his films themselves embody this dialectic to their very core: talky and intelligent, yes, but also aesthetically beautiful to behold (witness Nestor Almendros's lustrous color photography in Claire's Knee (1970) and Diane Baratier's in Astréa and Celadon for remarkable examples).

The pill, together with abortion, and what one might call “breeding unfriendly” changes to the economic model, have not only speeded up the pace of our decline but they have provided succour to attitudes which were most certainly encouraged with malevolent intent. The pill has been used far less to regulate the size of families as it has been used to put off childbirth, often altogether, and that has been of inestimable damage to us, collectively, as a people.

When Nyamare died all his property was taken by Mutandagavi for himself. He did not share with the sons of Chaitezvi. Chidziva and Chinamaringa complained about this and also opposed his succession to the chieftainship, saying that he was a bad man, as he did not want a person to pass through his home during the night because he thought that they were witchdoctors. When he saw a man passing through his home he used to ask his children to kill him.

Heh. To keep the insanity from taking over, why else? Well, that's not really the reason. ;) One reason for me personally would be to get some stories out there that I think would be a great story. Let's go back in time. See young Icewolf? Say hi, Young-Icewolf! Anyway, when I was younger, I would search and search for specific story plots, but would never find them in my libraries. So I came up with a brilliant idea.
But here's the thing about this CD: some tracks have the electronic sound and needlessly complicated arrangement of bad Asian karaoke, some tracks are clearly done by a musical theater major in the tradition of Rachel Barry, and still others, like Humpty Dumpty, seem to be sung by Kenny Loggins (I actually checked the liner notes and the lack of information leads me to believe that it is, indeed, Kenny Loggins).

And that is how the berating begins… again. I am so tired of the questions. And they are always the same questions over and over and over. I finally asked why he keeps asking the same thing over and over? The answer isn’t going to change within the hour, or even the day. He said because he is looking for the straight answer. The truth. The problem is, no matter what I say, or how I answer, unless it is what he believes in his head, I am lying. Now. To be honest, I am not always completely forthcoming. I don’t outright lie but I try to protect his feelings. Sometimes I just can’t take the big blow up that I know will ensue.

I knew, however, that I wasn't going to hack it as a "real" EMT when I discovered the concept of triage. Our book said the concept originated with the French, and the translation of the word was "to sort." I was horrified by the idea that I'd be responding to some major disaster and have to determine who would get help and who would have to wait, and really, who was beyond help and would have to be passed over. The idea has stuck with me, and while I'm not responding as an EMT, my life often feels like a constant triage.

They did two blood draws again today. Like I said, they couldn’t get Mom’s meter to work on me for some reason. But on their own, my numbers were lower! Whereas last time I was in the mid-to-high 400′s (I think my highest was 469 or something last time), this time I was in the low-to-mid 300′s! Rock on! They did their first test on me about 20 minutes after Mom dropped me off, which was 45 minutes after my shot. My blood glucose registered 348. About 2 hours later, it was 327. I’m happy!
Today the universe rewarded me with the best cut I have ever had. I tried out a new hairdresser, went with my hair styled and told her what I wanted.

I've never pictured myself living in the "Deep South" before, being someone who could be described as part of many different counter-cultures from Atheist to Socialist and everything in between, but if living on an Army base has taught me anything it's that you can have a perfectly lovely time with people who are 90% different from you, as long as you can find that 10% to talk about and avoid the heavy shit. I have plenty of social activity here on base with people I only have knitting or baby wearing in common with, but few people I really connect with. I'm sure that without a language barrier between myself and the general population my friend-options will be much broader! I've already found a La Leche League and an Attachment Parenting group in the area, and we plan to join the UU church as well.

I flew from Jeddah to Amman, Jordan on November 3rd, a short two hour flight over some gorgeous scenery. Immigration, baggage claim, and customs were easy enough, if not efficient or smoke-free. I grabbed an airport taxi and headed into downtown Amman to my hotel for the next few days - the Intercontinental. While not cheap, the Amman Intercon was a solid investment. Sizable room, comfortable bed, quality bathroom furnishings and amenities. I had lunch at one of the on-site restaurants, a Mexican place. Decent food and exactly what I wanted. I took a late-afternoon stroll to several craft shops in the neighborhood, though I didn't fall in love with anything, amazingly. Dinner was my favorite - room service! - and watching movies completed the restful evening.

In 2006, when I was in Peru at the SpiritQuest lodge, don Howard talked with me about how Ayahuasca works with us in terms of visions, healing, and influence in our lives. He said something curious that when I first heard it, I wondered if it was true. He told me that the visions we receive may be powerful, fearful, wonderful, or they may not come at all. “They are important,” he said, “but the real work that Ayahuasca will do with you will occur later. About three months after you get home – that is when you should look for the real effects of the medicine to manifest in your life.”

That is all well and good, but what are the best sources of fish oil? Consuming large quantities of fish would be the logical choice, but knowing that many species contain high levels of mercury, doing so might actually cause further damage to the brain.

Okayyy, let's see here. All the bands I'm thinking of have pretty crappy first records too. Led Zeppelin's first record, which I think they recorded maybe a year after being together, is pretty fucking impressive. Look at Minor Threat's early records. They came out of the gate and it was like, bang! Black Flag is a really important band to me, and they took a long time to get up to full speed. I like the post-hardcore stuff. I like their metal stuff, basically.
Following their evolutionary theme for the RB6, last week their car appeared with a logical development to the RB5 front wing.

The movie added in outside perspectives that I had wondered about during the book, but which could not be revealed as Katniss was narrating from her singular point of view. Katniss’ mother and sister were shown watching her on-screen. So was Gale, as she feigned romantic feelings for Peeta and kissed him in the cave. Haymitch, their mentor, was shown talking it up with the sponsors to get the much-needed gifts of medicine sent to them, and even persuading the game makers that they should allow Katniss and Peeta to continue on because the audience would love the romantic angle.

Once again, injuries had trimmed our eighteen man squad down to twelve fit players. Many of us arrived in the new Burridge tracksuits which club manager, Paul Dyke, had bought for just over a £100.

Back in my car I heard a nasty ripping sound coming from the stitching in the garment's shoulder when I reached over to my glove compartment. Fortunately, no damage appears to have been done.

The answer is equally as clear – they turn on themselves and before long the beautiful country that whites built is reduced to rubble and is just another African civil war zone – until the neo-colonizers move in.

I also think it requires more support from the community, and specifically more support from experts in the community. Experts meaning, accountants, business owners, investors, artists and academics. I believe that those people need to PUBLICLY support it and volunteer their public input, before it will go anywhere. As an artist and a writer, I’m going to be really sad if it doesn’t succeed.

The hospital was in Walnut Creek, CA and I wasn't aware of what a super nice area it is. The downtown is really cute, there are tons of nice restaurants, and so much shopping! I'd definitely like to come back and spend some more time here. Last night, my cousin Erin had everyone over to her house for dinner, and it was a great way to finish the weekend.
She slowly made her way across the anatomical landscape of the baby, pointing out the four chambers of the heart, the stomach, the kidneys, an arm bone and the umbilical cord. She spent a little too much time on the baby's brain, which sent my decreasing anxiety right back up the scale. Sensing this, she suggested that maybe she wasn't talking enough, telling me what she was doing. I told her a play-by-play would be really helpful, and it turned out to be, particularly as I squinted at the screen trying to decipher what I was seeing. Frankly, I don't know how they get anything from those images. I kept uttering "uh-huh" everytime she asked if we could see certain things, only because I felt it would be a poor reflection on my nascent motherhood if I admitted that actually, I couldn't see my baby's parts at all.
The Idiot approached and looked at a tiny little red welt on the woman’s upper chest that would not be easily visible under most cheap microscopes.
Today she started it up as well. I pulled her out of her cell and placed her in a holding cell with a camera in it. A Sgt came in and I told him what I was doing. He said that we had to notify medical on all breathing problems and they will make the determination if she is faking or needs to be transported. I told him I know this and what the SOP is but if you watch her on the camera you will see what I’m talking about. He says no call medical. So I did and she requests to be transported to the hospital. I’m thinking hell no, one because she is faking, the other is that I’ll have to go with her. Her request is approved and the Lt advises that we will just file on her out of custody. This means that we are just going to let her go and file a warrant to make sure she comes back. I’m relieved that I don’t have to go with her but she is clearly faking just to get out. Sure enough she gets loaded up in the ambulance and a block down the street she is released. Damn that’s EMS guys are good. It sure does seem like the patient always has a miraculous recovery at about the same spot ever time.

Because the Market Place was also where celebrations were held and important announcements made, it was appropriate that the Guildhall should be here, in the centre of things. Used as the Guildhall until 1935, when it was superseded by the new one (see above), it is now known as the Market House and accommodates the tourist information office. It was built between 1838 and 1840 and is now listed (Grade II).

We were in France last year and decided to drive from our gite here to the seaside resort of Royan on the Gironde estuary where the combined flows of the Dordogne, the Lot and the Garenne flow out to sea. I love the Atlantic Ocean. It was quite a drive, but worth it. I wanted to see the Belle Epoque villas so after an early lunch we walked along the seafront at La Grande Conche, a tree-lined promenade lined with the most amazing villas and with a great view across the Gironde. At the end of the 19th century sea-bathing became very fashionable and rich Parisians flocked to Royan to spend the summer. They built the most extraordinary villas along the seafront and in the area known as 'le parc'. Former residents include Picasso, Sarah Bernhardt and Emile Zola.

The Becks, Limbaughs and O’Reillys of the world do make it difficult at times to have a reasonable debate on foreign policy. They sometimes engage in smear tactics, such as calling people crazy, anti-semitic or other things, that totally end the debate. It is unfortunate. Ad hominems are so sixth grade.
So, without further ado, let’s find out what’s going on within that big brain of Carrie’s (brains, brains, BRAINS! Sorry, had to put that last one in).
Things really went to hell in a hand basket when Bisou joined the household. Just as big dogs want to greet you by putting their paws on your shoulders, little dogs want to greet you by putting their paws on your knees. The difference is, that a big dog with his paws on your shoulders is way more offensive than a little dog with her paws on your knees, so nobody looks askance if you correct the big dog by a yank on the collar or a knee on the breast. But it is physically impossible to knee a little dog on the breast, and as to yanking by the collar...by the time you've got your hands on it the entering guest is squealing sweet nothings at the miscreant, which makes the little dog jump even higher.
Man, I hope that the latter is where we are tomorrow. Whomever I'm talking to.

Kjersti has posted a very informative description of her time as "Russ". She talks in detail about her outfit and what the various bits meant.

Surely I’m not the first man to believe that he is cursed, and surely I won’t be the last. But I will be the last of my blood. To pass this genetic malfunction onto an innocent child, now that it has been fully realized, would be a cruel trick indeed. I have enough on my conscience without adding to the burden. And despite my now-reformed ways and self-imposed mission to earn my proverbial wings, it comes down to the fact that there is no salvation for an old salt like me. I sailed the seas of sin for far too long for that, and left too many victims burning in the wake of my vessel. I don’t need the added guilt of unwanted company in this, my tiny little circle of hell.

There was just so much I wanted to include in this layout but just couldn't fit it all on. As you can tell I don't do "minimalist". I so enjoy the "journey" as much as the "destination". I admire people that do, but I can't!!!

Sure, sure, I can hear all the negative nellies now–something is bound to go wrong! What if the dead get hungry? Stuff and nonsense. I know exactly what I’m doing, okay? Nothing is going to go wrong, and when a zombie pulls you out of your burning car wreck because I had thoughtfully stationed a team of them on the shoulder of the Mass Pike, picking up litter, you can thank me later.

For instance... earlier today I told Farmmom I was going on thirty six hours without a cigarette. Only problem with that is that yesterday I was at forty eight hours. Somehow my brain added twenty four to forty eight and came up thirty six, and I didn't even think about it until I started to write this post.

I really enjoyed reading The Seasons on Henry's Farm; A Year of Food and Life on a Sustainable Farm by Terra Brockman. Henry is Terra's youngest brother who has taken over the job of running the family farm. Terra moved away from the homestead to go to college and spent a good fifteen years living in cities and having a career before finally returning home to help her brother on the farm. Because of the type of land, rolling hills rather than plains, the farm did not succumb to the move in the 1960's and 70's to become a single crop farm growing just corn or soybeans. The land didn't lend itself to that type of farming, so though it did go through hard times then, because Terra's parents never really got on board with the 'modern' way to farm, it was very easy to restablish the farm as a sustainable, organic one. In fact, much of their sustainable, organic practices are simply doing things the way their great grandparents did, on the farm.
The hard fact is, however, that I am writing this note on a laptop, using a paperless word processor with built-in headmaster for checking spelling and grammar, connected to a virtual sea of information through the WIFI at Butler’s Chocolate Café at Jinnah International Airport, Karachi.
As members of our organizations we make many promises - we promise to go to meetings, be on committees, go to events, raise money.... the list goes on and on. But, the most important promise we make is that of our Ritual. No matter our organization, when we go through our initiation rite we are given an expectation - one set forth by our founders - and challenged to live our lives in the path they've laid out.

The invitations had caused quite the stir, just as she’d intended; simple black on white, with the big, bold letters at the bottom – CLOTHING OPTIONAL. She’d left instructions downstairs with the concierge to keep them all waiting in the lobby until the entire guest list had arrived. Then, and only then, were the dozen special friends allowed into the private elevator which brought them up to paradise.
I had a few auditions scheduled after I returned, one with Ballet San Jose. After the audition a trio of participants stayed to speak with the director. I felt good about my performance in the audition, and felt fortunate to speak to the Director afterward, but I'd had that feeling before. That feeling, the fluttery, suppressed nervousness, had been rewarded in the past with nothing. I waited, trying to convince myself I was waiting for nothing, or if not nothing, then at least more rejection. I was formulating plan-B's right and left. I was going to "get on with my life." The boyfriend kept talking me down.

In the past I have said that Atheists are organizing as a religion. Then I posted something about a Court decision that said that Atheism is a religion! Then we all read the article about Richard Dawkins when Carl Packman said "Dawkins, in choosing a form of firebrand fundamentalist atheism over the discipline science, is no longer the champion of reason but rather a kind of evangelical against religion"

Anyway, during this visit to the South's surrender spot, ooops, I mean to "where the country was brought together" spot, they were having a Civil War re-enactment. Well, really more of an encampment, since there wasn't any battle waging going on, but a small demonstration.
One I picked up my sweet tea and my order, I looked around for a seat. Not finding one, I did spot a sign that read “picnic area out back.” I wasn’t sure if this was some joke, along the lines of all the other signs, to pick at unsuspecting visitors, but I tried it anyway. I made my way past the kitchen, through a screen door, past a washing area, and old pit, and into a small field out back. Sure enough, picnic tables lined the sides of the field nearest the trees, and most were full. I took a spot at an empty table and dug in to my plate.
Why does a woman make the conscious decision to stay with a man who has such little regard for her, such little respect? Not only that, but I find that many women actually justify his actions or pretend they didn't happen. They convince themselves that he is faithful, that he loves them, that it won't happen again.

Good-ol'-fashioned film noir, right down to the private eye who is framed for murder. My favorite part was when Ball opened the door to get the milk from the milkman. She has her back to the camera, and the audience sees past her, through the door, and watches the milkman. He hands her the paper that was lying outside her door, she tucks it under her arm, we see Stevens' hand take it away, and the milkman, who also saw his hand, gives her a sly look. No words; just a really good moment that I can't describe adequately. I do have one question for those of you who have seen several Clifton Webb films: does he always play the same character? I've only seen him in this and in Laura, and the roles are, for all intensive purposes, the very same.

Prophet T.B. Joshua of The SCOAN has made reference to the ills of this kind of economy, in one of his recent sermons. Of course, he had spoken to diverse media establishments, before now, on the vision of blood flowing on the streets; blood which should not be flowing for any reason whatever. He had told the world that hatred, jealousy, political mischief and political miscalculations would most often, lead to bloodshed. Blood is being shed, till now, by the militants in the Niger Delta, and the Boko Haram sect in the north. Such situations have also occurred in Ivory Coast, Libya, Egypt, Algeria, and Tunisia. There are threats of Boko Haram’s likely invasion of Mali, too. Blood is flowing because of “struggles for power”, even when those who eventually secure power are not likely to invest progressively in human and mineral resources.

It's a good thing that getting caught offside does not count as a foul, otherwise Tottenham Hotspur would be in trouble. Emmanuel Adebayor was the season's most prolific offender in that regard, reclaiming a crown that he previously won in 2008 and succeeding last year's most regular transgressor, Jermain Defoe, another two-times winner. In fairness, Darren Bent, another previous winner, was on course to challenge hard for this year's title until he fell victim to injury. But Bent's absence is only part of the reason why Aston Villa were the only team in the league not to score a single goal from a corner all season. They also scored fewer headers (three) than anyone else – while the only team to concede more headed goals than Villa (12) were Sunderland (13). West Bromwich Albion conceded the fewest (five). Villa's total of seven victories was their lowest in a season since 1890‑91, when there were only 12 teams in the league.

As the twentieth century progressed, our industry (along with many others) began to consolidate. Smaller presses were bought by larger presses – grandparents of the major international conglomerates we are now familiar with, and instead of multiple offices over shops, we began to see the establishment of warehouses – and the beginning of a distancing between customer and publisher – as independent bookselling took off. (Bookshops had previously existed in the university cities – but gradually they were established in most sizeable market towns). These bookshops were supplied by the publishers’ central warehouse, while smaller publishers continued to supply direct.

Most everything in this jewellery store was out of my price range (but I did buy a gorgeous charm for my charm bracelet). Why did we visit? I like "firsts" and this company is the oldest jeweller in North America. I am such a magpie, so just ogling the wares was fun, but I also like a bit of "everyday" history. Sure, sites dedicated to monumental events are important, but this store represents a tiny bit of ordinary history and that is interesting to me. Plus, they are home to the gurgling cod.

A daylight collaring operation offered a rare opportunity to catch some good photos and video, so before we opened the trap, we stationed three people with still and video cameras at different angles to the trap entrance. I was crouched behind a tree and a snow bank a few yards in front the trap, hoping that she would run by me. The lid creaked up, and a few seconds passed, and then, like a periscope, the collar antenna emerged, followed by F3′s head. We had waited for about ten minutes for M57 to leave the trap; F3 took one look at freedom and then she poured out of the trap’s mouth and, in a blur of snow, streaked towards me. I didn’t realize it until I looked at the photos and videos later, but she actually headed directly towards me before catching sight of me and then veering to the left, around me, and then off into the woods. She took about five seconds to disappear.

would you have said?
This power struggle comes from two different, but related, places in our life. First of all, it is our sin nature that wants to crown us Lord of all. There is only one God and we are not Him, so this creates natural tension and messes things up. Second of all, it is a result of ignorance. If people really were students of the Word of God, they would see how important it is to keep God as the center of our life. We would see that the only firm foundation is in Jesus Christ, not in our own strength or abilities. The other thing is that there are so many examples of people in the Bible who have gone on ahead of God and have had very serious problems happen to them.

Strewing itself is not some magical, transcendental thing. A smorgasbord is a wonderful analog. Or dim sum. I love dim sum! Hey, let's go get some lunch when we're done chatting, ok? Essentially, strewing is any sort of hint about what's available in the wide world which might act as a springboard for their curiosity. Sure, books are good. A book on astronomy left on the coffee table can lead to a mini-career, or even a professional career!, for the right child. However, books are not the be-all and end-all of strewing. Seeing a cup of water expand when it turns to ice in the freezer can lead to a sophisticated exploration of chemistry. Why the hell does water expand when it freezes while almost everything else contracts? Wow! I never heard of triple points before. That's cool! And they're off on a wild race to knowledge, where they soon discover, if they haven’t already, that there's no finish line and that it's a lifelong pursuit. For another child, finding an interesting pebble on a hiking trail might open a path that leads all the way from that small trail to the entire universe of geology.

Reilly scratched his face in thought. He had managed to grab a few hours sleep in the officers lounge while waiting for the prints on Jacobs dead guy to come back. Jacobs hadn’t been lying. The guy had indeed paid a visit to the morgue. His prints came back as a one Mark Lindquist, 27 and his picture matched the one on file at the station. According to the report he had been found lying face down in his drive way dead. It had been another Coroner who had evaluated him on scene and had put down apparent drug OD as the possible cause. Neighbor statements substantiated that he was known to do drugs and that he had no next to kin. An autopsy had been pending.

Gapard would try to fight, but the vectors would be too col to even touch the levers. The Cherubim would take this advantage to freeze Gepard. Meanwhile, Andy would dig deep enough to find one part of the legendary Aquarion hidden in the earth. Before Andy realized what he did, hot water would gush out from the hole and shoot to the surface. The warm water, with bananas included, seeped into Gepard and created a warm hot spring with a mixture of the heat of the water with the substance of the bananas. Not only that, Mix, Yunoha, Malloy, Zessica, and Mikono would find themselves inside Gepard as well. With thanks to the warmth, Gepard deassembled and turned into Evol. Here, Evol would launch a multiple infinity punch attack at the Cherubim, revealing the shape of a bunch of bananas before destroying the Cherubim. Although they found one part of the legendary Aquarion, there were still more to find. As Mikage states, the better parts of Aquarion were not found yet.
Digging waaaay into the recipe box last Sunday, I decided to make Chinese dumplings. D. and I used to make them all the time B.C. (Before Children) when we had free time. Feeling ambitious, I chose two different kinds of dumplings and two different kinds of sauce. We ate a little late because I got started a little late, but these aren’t hard to do – just time-consuming. This is a great Sunday afternoon recipe when you can devote the time, and the kids could actually help. Miss E ate the crab pot stickers the next night for dinner and loved them (I was very pleasantly surprised!!). The sauces can be prepared in advance and refrigerated until you serve the dumplings.

This book could easily be taken for another fluffy coffee-table offering (though not in ‘coffee-table’ format). I read it from cover to cover in around 20 minutes, but it is clearly not meant to be speed-read. It is more like a meditative poem to the beauty of living, than a guide-book. Taken in small sections, as a daily meditative practice, it may be able to do just what it claims.
When I was finally allowed the privilege of joining a crew on a patrol van, my new mentor, crew-member and driver, was a middle-aged Coloured man by the name of Sergeant Schoeman. He was a sturdy robust man with a joyful pleasant attitude. His huge build and his broad moustache, which he loved twisting upwards at both ends, gave him that typical authoritative military appearance. I have many pleasant memories about this man and can recall how thankful I was, on several occasions, that I had him as crew-member on patrol.

Let us not forget, there was no reason for City Hall to ban the use of Dataran Merdeka, nor for the 11th hour court order restricting crowd movement. If anyone had planned and maneuvered for an untoward incident to occur, and is to blame for the ensuing police violence, it is the Umno-BN and its agencies. And Najib, as the head, has to take the responsibility.
Finally, Taylor, your apology, or lack thereof. I totally get that this was all a big shock, and you've put a lot into this company to have some angry-Native-people-who-can't-take-a-joke try and take that away. But your apology is pretty much a text book response to this type of thing, so much so that I almost laughed. Read this, if you don't believe me. We're not interpreting this as offensive, it is offensive. It's not honoring to have someone make a mockery of your culture, traditions, and spirituality. I don't find it respectful when someone makes light of the insurmountable loss of land and life from broken treaties, or basically tells me that I can't take a joke, when the joke is at the expense of my culture.

After going in and finding out that mass would be at nine, we ran into a street performer who was singing giant crowd-pleasers like “We Are The World,” so we stopped and sang along for a little while. It was such a beautiful moment, all of those people surrounding each other, hailing from many different countries, I’m sure, all lost within his song at the exact same time.. It was overwhelming and I loved it.

It was an absolute treat to read all of these, but I enjoyed Split by a Kiss and My So-Called Afterlife the most. Both hilarious, but coming from completely different angles. I'll be following up with glowing reviews over the coming weeks while starting on my next TBR pile.

I nipped straight down the hill to the little Spa shop in the village and there on the shelf was just what I needed, a packet of ground hazelnuts.
I know that I’m allowing fear to take over and rule my thoughts and emotions right now. But I have to be honest with what’s going on in my head and my heart right now, otherwise I’m going to be completely overwhelmed with all of it.
“Who’s your favorite author?”
Bleep! Bleep! Bleep!…”N*****.” No, it was not a rap video nor a Chris Rock comedy routine that let the “N” word rip today: rather, it was CNN’s American Morning.

I hear a lot of mothers touting that they are not friends with their children, and that we mothers shouldn't be friends with our children. I also hear an assumption that single moms are too close to our children, that we share too much with them and make them grow up too fast.

Every time I visit Patan - usually to see my Charya dance master Raju Sakya, visit a tantric temple, or to check on some Charya ornaments hand-made by traditional artisans, I try to get in a trip to what I call the "House of Wo."

You want serious literature? This isn't it. Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife is pure candy, and I have to say I haven't had as much plain fun reading a book in quite a while. Heaving bosoms and all.
Song of Treason was first published by Simon & Schuster in paperback last year – at least, under that title. Because as Jeremy explains in this blog post, it originally appeared under the title Free Country in 2010, the idea being that each of the three novels in the trilogy would have "Free" in the title (the third book was to be called Free World). Simon & Schuster, however, "felt there was a danger that Free Country might not signal to those who hadn't read the first book in the series, Free Agent, that it was a spy thriller". Jeremy agreed, and came up with the more apposite Song of Treason. (Incidentally, the novel was published as an ebook for the first time last week.)
I'd LOVE, LOVE, LOVE to see more middle grade novels from self-pubbers. Now that the Harry Potter ebooks are available, I'd say it's not long before MG explodes in ebook format. Are you ready? (I am...wrapping one up as I write this.)

Due to the bullying I was so paranoid that I would constantly think that she was talking about me or something. The fact she admitted that most people ask her why she hangs out with me didn’t help. Eventually she said, If you don’t believe me than why are we friends. So I stopped being her friend. But after that things with my other peers got better some how. Kids stopped at least letting me hear them talk about me. the kid who sat next to me got nicer after realizing we listen to the same music.
She tried to move but couldn’t. The men’s grip on her increased again, fingers pressing hard into her arms, bruising her. The drop fell, landing on her tongue, and another quickly followed it. The hooded man tightened his fist and more dripped into her mouth. She tried not to swallow, didn’t want to taste his blood. It slid down her throat, one drop after another, until she wanted to be sick.
Indeed, the contagion most feared by Rebekah Brooks and James Murdoch is that involving allegations of hacking after the 2005-6 Inclusion Zone – ie, that zone within which Newscorp admits unequivocal guilt for hacking people illegally. Adverse revelations inside the period would be devastating (especially if they had any bearing upon the Brown/Blair plot story); but much more danger, yet again, lies in the upcoming civil cases pertaining to the period 2007-10, to which (I’m led to understand) a substantial number of allegations pertain.

In 2008, the premiers of Ontario and Quebec pledged that each province would protect half of its northern boreal forests. There is now hope that the 190 million acres of boreal forest in Ontario and Quebec will eventually be made off-limits. Last year, 21 of Canada’s largest logging companies and nine conservation groups proposed the Canadian Boreal Forest Agreement to support the protection of more than seventy million acres.
Wednesday 28th December - another outfit I can finally fit back into to! As my son would say, "Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah!" I really like this outfit because it feels a bit more fun and fresh compared to what I usually wear, and I love the mix of the neutral colours - its not too far out of my comfort zone, but is jazzier than all black.
Well, yeah. According to Mike Dooley, the missing ingredient was me. It's all well and good to trust in the Universe to create abundance in our lives, but first we have to make contact, by doing what we can, with what we have, from where we are. We have to engage the magic, start the ball rolling. We have to take a baby step in the direction of our dreams. Then and only then will the Universe move to do its part, and kick in a string of inspiration and synchronicities and right-people-at-the-right-time coinkydinks to keep things flowing along.

The day we bombed Afghanistan was my twentieth birthday. I remember being called in to work for a night shift because a co-worker was sick, and dragging my feet. I had just made the world's deadliest margarita (you can drink in Italy at 18, so yes, it was legal!), and hated the thought of going in for yet another twelve hour shift. I thought what we were doing in Afghanistan was right, righteous, and beyond reproach. Even as the War on Terror extended beyond Afghanistan's borders--as the Patriot Act was passed and the Iraq war started--I believed we were doing the right thing.
When modern authors tackle the popular fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood, they generally feature a strong heroine, who may kill the wolf herself, or otherwise outsmart it. This makes us feel like we've progressed so far from the Victorian simpering victim idea of the female protagonist, but actually this empowering ending is actually only hearkening back to the original Grimm story, which includes an addendum that is usually forgotten. (By "original Grimm story," I don't mean that the Grimms collected the first version of the tale, simply that this was how the tale appeared in their collection.)

Now obviously there are other pressures in the trucking industry and there are also individual factors for individual companies. But as someone who has been consistently worried about the economic outlook in Australia due to household de-leverage this turn of events in the PSI and 1st Fleets collapse reminds me of the lead in to the recession we had to have 22 years ago.
